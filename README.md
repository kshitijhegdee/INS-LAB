## Overview

In this lab, we dive into some fundamental encryption techniques that have historically been used in cryptography. These techniques include classical ciphers, which provide a foundation for understanding modern cryptographic algorithms. Each cipher is implemented as a separate Python script.

### Goals of the Lab:
- Understand basic encryption and decryption methods.
- Learn about the security weaknesses of classical ciphers.
- Implement and test the ciphers in a networked environment.

## Lab Exercises

### Caesar Cipher
The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the simplest encryption techniques where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number. This script demonstrates the encryption and decryption of messages using the Caesar Cipher.

### Monoalphabetic Cipher
The **Monoalphabetic Cipher** is a type of substitution cipher where each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a corresponding letter in the alphabet. The cipher used here is a fixed substitution cipher.

### Playfair Cipher
The **Playfair Cipher** is a digraph substitution cipher where pairs of letters are encrypted. This method uses a 5x5 matrix of letters and follows specific rules to perform encryption and decryption.

All of these cipher implementations can be found in the `cipher/` folder of this repository.
